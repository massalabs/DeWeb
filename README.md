# DeWeb: On-chain Decentralized Web Gateway

DeWeb is your gateway to the decentralized web, enabling seamless access to websites stored on-chain from any device, anywhere in the world.

## Description

DeWeb revolutionizes web accessibility by providing tools to upload, edit, and view websites directly on the blockchain. The project includes two binaries:

- [`deweb-cli`](./cli/README.md): A command-line tool for deploying and managing on-chain websites.
- [`deweb-server`](./server/README.md): A server application that allows users to access websites stored on-chain through a web browser.
